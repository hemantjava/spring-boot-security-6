Summary:
JWT is a token format that can be used independently for authentication and information exchange.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that uses tokens (often JWTs) to grant limited access to resources on behalf of a user.
Both are commonly used together in modern security practices, with OAuth 2.0 often issuing JWTs as access tokens.


JWT is a self-contained token format used for secure information exchange and authentication. It consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources without exposing credentials. OAuth 2.0 typically issues tokens (often JWTs) for access and involves interaction between clients, resource servers, and authorization servers. JWTs are used within OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization purposes.
