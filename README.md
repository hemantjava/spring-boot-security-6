Here's a comparison between JWT (JSON Web Token) and OAuth 2.0 in a tabular form:

Feature	JWT (JSON Web Token)	OAuth 2.0
Purpose	Token format used for secure transmission of information.	Authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access a userâ€™s resources without exposing credentials.
Type	A token that can be used standalone for authentication or information exchange.	A protocol that provides a way to delegate access to user resources.
Structure	Consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature (in Base64 format).	Involves multiple token types: Access Token, Refresh Token, and optionally ID Token (with OpenID Connect).
Usage	Commonly used in single sign-on (SSO), API authentication, and transmitting information securely.	Primarily used for delegating authorization for third-party applications to access resources on behalf of the user.
Transport	Typically sent in HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>).	Often involves redirects and exchanges between client, resource server, and authorization server. Tokens can be sent in headers or query strings.
Token Validation	Self-contained; validation can be done locally by verifying the signature and checking claims.	Requires interaction with an authorization server to validate access tokens, though some implementations use self-contained tokens like JWTs.
Expiration	Typically includes an expiration time (exp claim).	Access tokens typically have a short lifespan; refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens.
Revocation	Cannot be easily revoked after issuance unless the application maintains a blacklist.	Revocation can be managed by the authorization server, allowing tokens to be invalidated.
Scalability	Scales well for stateless authentication, as tokens are self-contained.	More complex due to interaction between multiple components (client, resource server, authorization server).
Security Considerations	Vulnerable to issues if not properly secured (e.g., token leakage). Signature validation is critical.	Requires careful management of token storage and exchange, as well as protection against attacks like token interception and misuse.
Standards	Defined in RFC 7519.	Defined in RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) and RFC 6750 (Bearer Token Usage).
Typical Use Cases	API authentication, single sign-on (SSO), securely transmitting claims between parties.	Third-party authorization (e.g., allowing an app to access your Google account), delegated access, resource sharing without password sharing.
Summary:
JWT is a token format that can be used independently for authentication and information exchange.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that uses tokens (often JWTs) to grant limited access to resources on behalf of a user.
Both are commonly used together in modern security practices, with OAuth 2.0 often issuing JWTs as access tokens.
